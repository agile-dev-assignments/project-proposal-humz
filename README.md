# New York Real Estate Helper
### Project proposal by Humza Khan

## Explanation
### Why, and for whom?
Inspired by my experiences looking for apartments in New York City over the last couple of years, I propose a web application to assist prospective residents in finding suitable apartments to rent or purchase. I aim to tailor this app for each end user — both tenants/buyers and landlords/sellers. Members of the former group will be able to painlessly filter through the thousands of properties available in the Big Apple based on their needs and preferences, and members of the latter group will be able to put their properties up for rent/sale.

## Methodology
### How?
Of course, applications like this one and others such as StreetEasy are really just databases, containing a list of properties. What I believe would set an application like this one apart from its contemporaries is the way I present and organize this data. As we all know, NYC is divided into various “zones” like Greenwich Village, Hell’s Kitchen, Upper East Side, etc. When I was helping my mother look for apartments to purchase in Manhattan, she would always ask, “is X a good area?” or “what is there to do around Y?” Thus, to capture the great diversity and variance New York has to offer, I will subdivide each of the 5 buroughs into smaller zones.

Each zone would have a number of ratings (from 1 to 5 stars), conveying important factors such as safety, entertainment, price of living, and ease of navigation (proximity to subway, bus stops, etc.) Users living in or familiar with some zone will be able to offer their ratings, such that it would be easy for a foreigner moving to the city to make their own deductions on where they would like to live. If someone wanting to move to Brooklyn places a priority on living in a safe area with lots of entertainment options, for example, they would be able to integrate this preference into their search query. This would give end users a reliable way to understand the intricacies of the city, without relying on the clickbait-y and often misleading descriptions typically posted by agents/rentors on other websites.

## Scope
A project like this will hopefully be of appropriate scope for a small group of programmers. The challenge will be writing back-end code that is quickly able to index a large number of properties in the database using the users' search preferences. Hopefully this is a task not too simple nor too ambitious for 3-5 students.
